# Assignment-22-Home_Sales_
This is the module 22 challenge where the highlight is processing massive data with the shortest processing time. The data source consist of home sale data which is retrived as a url link. <br/>

<h1>Key Note</h1>
Due to technical issue with the installation, the assignment was coded through google collab. Hence, for this script to work, it must be runnning through the google website.<br/>
The script utilise three different codings:<br/>
1. Cache<br/>
2. Parquet<br/>
3. Normal<br/>
The differences between the three essentially stems down to how long it takes for the computer to process the code request,along with the filtering and then display the result.<br/>
While the assignment doesn't really showcase the vast differences between the seconds. Theoretically, with larger dataset, within the millions. The difference can be noticable.
